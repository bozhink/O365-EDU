This script is designed to create a Dynamic Distribution Group which includes all admins in the org. This DDL may be added to students mailboxes who implement the acceptance permissions, to allow these admins to email each of the respective students. This script assumes the Department attribute for admins contains the string "admin", and uses this attribute to populate and keep the DDL up to date.
