Script Name:
Set-Classroom_License_for_Some_Users.ps1

Synopsis:
This script imports a list of users, and adds the Class Dashboard Preview license to each account in the csv. The users.csv must reside in the c:\temp directory, be called Users.csv, and be formatted as shown below. Only one column is needed in the file. The header should be "UserPrincipalName" and each cell beneath it should be populated with the UPN of the users you want to add license for. There are no switches or parameters needed to run this script.

CSV Format:
Userprincipalname
user1@contoso.com
user2@contoso.com
user3@contoso.com

Syntax Examples:
